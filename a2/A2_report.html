			<h2>Subtheme: Quantifying Condo Conversions</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<p>
				The article "Renters at a brand-new Somerville building surprised by news: Millbrook's going condo" outlines a tale of a building in Somerville that was converted in condos. Interestingly, the building was constructed only the year prior to the announcement for conversion. Renters were not informed of the transition, and they were displaced from their homes if they could not afford buying the place. Some of these rentals were specifically set aside for low income / artists. This sad story made me question about the prevalence of condo conversions. Are they universally happening or are segments of the population targetted more frequently? Which areas are specifically convertted? What economic incentives exist for condo conversions? These larger questions lead me to generate the following three sub questions for my analysis.
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>What buildings are most likely to get converted?</li>
				<li>Where do condo conversions happen in Boston?</li>
				<li>How does the value of property change?</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
			Each of the questions were explored with an initial exploration into the data quality and profiling of the fields. From there, there is a deep dive into the question and specific fields that may help to answer the question better.

			<h3>Preliminary Dataset Understanding</h3>
			<p>
				Before even diving into a deeper analysis, I had to first figure out what each of the LU codes stood for. Based on the Property Assessment guidelines, here are the 
				<ol>
					<li>A - Residential 7 or more units</li>
					<li>E - Tax exempt</li>
					<li>AH - Agricultural/Horticultural</li>
					<li>EA - Tax exempt (121A)</li>
					<li>C - Commercial</li>
					<li>I - Industrial</li>
					<li>CC - Commercial condominium</li>
					<li>R1 - Residential 1 family</li>
					<li>CD - Residential condominium unit</li>
					<li>R2 - Residential 2 family</li>
					<li>CL - Commercial land</li>
					<li>R3 - Residential 3 family</li>
					<li>CM - Condominium main (physical structure housing all related condo units with no assessed value)</li> 
					<li>R4 - Residential 4 or more family</li>
					<li>RC - Mixed use (res. and comm.)</li>
					<li>CP - Condo parking</li>
					<li>RL - Residential land</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<p>
				In the above figue, we see the spread of land use within the dataset. Residential land (R1, R2, R3) is the most prevalent with commerical right behind that. However, we notice there are some duplicates in the initial data with RL appearing a few times. Therefore, we must clean up this to fully analyse the impact. This part of the analysis will be conducted further in the first question deep dive.

			<p>
				The above histogram is supposed to show a clean distribution of years. However, we notice that some of the years are denoted as "0". Currently, the data implies that some properties are built in year 0, but that may have just been a default value. Since this is not possible, it is clear that we need to clean the data to remove any data that has a year 0 when creating plots with the year built field. An analysis involving the year built will be further explored with question 1.

			</figure>

			<p>
				The above scatter chart is helping to visualize the distribution of the post years and the total values. We find some initial insights that are quite interesting. First, there are several gaps in the data, as this dataset claims there were no post years in 2018, 2021, and 2022. Since there is no clear understanding as to why there is a lack of data, we examined the relationship between the prior and post years. Based on the data cleaning, all the prior years are the year of the conversion and the post year is plus one to the prior year. Additionally, it is interesting that most of property values cluster around the lower values of 0M to 10M. 
			</p>

			<h3>What buildings are most likely to get converted?</h3>
			
			<p>
				We continue to hear in the news that many buildings are getting converted into condos. Is there a correlation between certain attributes about a building and the likelihood that it gets converted? 
			</p>

			<p>
				To investigate this, I first looked into what types of building are most prevalent prior to any conversion.
			</p>

			<p>
				After cleaning up the duplicate labels, we compare the building types prior to the conversion and the building types post the conversion.
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="1_b_comparison.png" alt="" width="1000"/>
				<figcaption>

			</figure>

			<p>We instantly notice a sharp change in the distribution of the land use types. There is a great increase in condominiums after the conversions of the buildings and stark reduction in the number of residential units. Specifically, "CM" accounts for the majority of all the land use in Boston after the conversions, as per this dataset.</p>

			<p>Seeing the total numbers before and after, I wonder what types of buildings are most likely to convert into other buildings?</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="1_c_heatmap.png" alt="" width="1000"/>
				<figcaption>

			</figure>

			<p>To visualize the land use label to land use label conversion, I generated a heatmap to see which land use labels are descreasing most frequently and which land use labels are increasing. In the heatmap, the "CM" column shows the greatest amount of activity with special attention from the residential land as expected. We also notice that very few properties are converted to be tax exempt or residential. The heatmap indicates through the darkness of the color the number of property conversions of that type.</p>

			<p>At the same time, it is still quite difficult to understand what percentage of the "CM" conversions are attributed to each of the land use labels / property types.</p>

				<img src="1_d_pie_chart.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>

			</figure>

			<p>Confirming our suspicions from earlier, we can tell that the residential buildings, R2 and R3, really contributed to the CM land use type. It makes sense that 2-family and 3-family land was frequently converted into condominiums. Also, it was interesting that CD, another condominium type for residential condominiums, converted into CM as well. CM is the most general of the condos. </p>
			
			<p>Beyond the building type, the year that the original building is built can also impact if there is a conversion.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="1_e_built_histogram.png" alt="" />

			</figure>
			<p>In on our preliminary analysis, we had constructed a very raw / initial histogram. However, in this revised version, we can see that most of the properties are built in 1900-1909. There are two peaks in the data: one around the early 1900s and one in 2010s. There is a clear decrease in the number of properties in the 1930s-1970s which can make sense with the Great Depression, World War II, and the Baby Boom of the 50s. Many families were seeking the "American Dream" and leaving big cities for the suburbs. While we cannot know for sure, there might not have been many buildings built during that time.</p>

			<p>Through the analysis above, we have done a deep dive into the types of properties and the age of the properties are most likely to be converted.</p>
