			<h2>Subtheme: Quantifying Condo Conversions</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<p>
				The article "Renters at a brand-new Somerville building surprised by news: Millbrook's going condo" outlines a tale of a building in Somerville that was converted in condos. Interestingly, the building was constructed only the year prior to the announcement for conversion. Renters were not informed of the transition, and they were displaced from their homes if they could not afford buying the place. Some of these rentals were specifically set aside for low income / artists. This sad story made me question about the prevalence of condo conversions. Are they universally happening or are segments of the population targetted more frequently? Which areas are specifically convertted? What economic incentives exist for condo conversions? These larger questions lead me to generate the following three sub questions for my analysis.

			<ol>
				<li>What buildings are most likely to get converted?</li>
				<li>Where do condo conversions happen in Boston?</li>
				<li>How does the value of property change?</li>
