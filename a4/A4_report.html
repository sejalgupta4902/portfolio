    <h2>Proposition: Abortion is Accessible to Everyone</h2>

      		<h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Diverging Color Scheme with a Nonzero Center (Deceptive: 2): The diverging color scheme (specifically red and blue) plays into the political representations of the perspectives. Since this visualization was trying to support that abortion is easily accessible, it makes sense that the viewer would want to blame the "liberals" or "pro-choice" individuals which is associated with blue. To play into the existing frameworks of the viewer, the visualization is more persuasive because the viewer will subconsciously make associations without having to directly explain them. To really make this deceptive, I changed the center of the color scale to be -2, so more of the states seem to have created new clinics. To skew the scale actually worked really well in portraying the opinion that more clinics are being created. However, the results so seem a bit fishy with New York removing clinics, while Texas is adding them. Therefore, the viewer may not be completely fooled and may begin to question the authenticity of the data. Other alternatives I considered were only displaying the liberal states or only displaying a region of states. However, I ultimately chose to display all the states because I was worried that viewers may easily question why only specific states were at the focal point of the visualization, detering their attention from the actual perspective conveyed.</li>
				<li>Titles and Map Annotations about New Clinics Created (Deceptive: 1): The title "Abortion: Is it too easy?" is quite blunt with the perspective of the visualization. The other annotations that only portray the increase in clinics are a bit more subtle in their delivery, persuading the reader that there is more abortion clinics in the USA. For the annotation "More than 40 new clinics created", I transformed the data to only include values where new clinics were created, removing instances where clinics were shut down. If I had just looked at the net change in the number of clinics, it actually would have been a negative figure. To display the sum of the new clinics was a strategic move that actually worked really well, since the viewer doesn't have access to the raw data. However, the other annotations may not have been too great because the viewer may questions why New York or Florida weren't highlighted. Lastly, the title may not be suitable for the visualization if the purpose is to remain neutral, so a less charged title may help. Originally, I considered placing the net number of clinics in each state, but the visualization was too busy and difficult to interpret. Additionally, I considered including a table of the top states that had new clinics, but the table felt disconnected from the map visualization and wasn't effective in delivery. Thus, I decided on small text annotations instead of larger annotations. </li>
				<li>Comparison between US Regions rather US States (Deceptive: 0.5): The bottom two bar plots show four US regions and the number of abortion providers or publicly funded abortions. The states are grouped into regions based on the separation by the US Census Bureau Regions and Divisions dataset (Joined on the US State in the provided dataset). The grouping of the states into regions makes the bar plot easier to interpret by reducing 50 columns into 4 columns, so the viewer is able to verify the claims. Additionally, the grouping actually hides the variation amongst states and allows for a more homogenous comparison between the regions. While the differences are hidden, the bar plot representations aren't the most interesting, loweing the chance that the attention of the viewer is grabbed. I considered pie charts, scatter plots, and dual axis charts; aside from the increased pockets of whitespace, I wanted to keep the focus on the map visualization, so I tried to simplify the visualizations or graphics below. </li>
				<li>Logarithmic Scale on the Publicly Funded Abortions (Deceptive: 2): The botton left bar plot is very deceptive. The scale for the y-axis is Logarithmic which can skew the reader to believe the impact is much greater than it actually is. Readers at quick glance will be swayed to believe that there are a lot of publicly funded abortions in the US in all the regions. This is effective in convincing the viewer that the access to abortions is not a concern; however, this is effective only if the reader quickly peruses the information rather than deeply analyzes the content. Therefore, there is a chance that this deception may be very clear to the viewer, so hopefully, this remains hidden to amplify the impact. As alternatives, I considered comparing the publicly funded abortions over a couple of years, but the results weren't looking too great. Also, I tried to create a pie chart or keep a linear scale, but the representation was not as convincing.</li>
				<li>Totals for Public Funding and Teenage Abortions (Earnest: 1): The numerical values in the visualization are really descriptive and persuasive in showing the great impact. For instance, the grand scale of the values $71M and approximately 60,000 teenage abortions make it easy to persuade individuals that abortion is easily available. The size, bold, and center location of the metrics emphasizes the impact of the values. To obtain this information, I filtered out null values and added up the total around the US for the greatest impact. While the values are impactful, too many values or text can be difficult for the viewer to read. Specifically, this version of the text is from historic data (2015 and 2017), reducing the impact since viewers may not feel connected to the years. As the values aren't as relevant anymore, I tried to explore opportunities of placing the information in tables, but the values weren't as impactful. Secondly, I wanted to place the individual values on the map, but once again, the map was too crowded and not digestable. Thus, it made the most sense to simply choose two statistics to display to the user.</li>

      	<h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

		<figure>
			<img src="../a4/prochoice.png" width="90%" alt="" />
			<figcaption>
				Lack of access to abortion is portrayed through the sheer percentage of counties without a clinic, the great percentage of women without a clinic, and the long round trip tips to a nearby abortion clinic.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>
			Design Decisions and Rationale:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Reversed Axis in the Main Graph (Deceptive: 1): Like the Iraq's Bloody Toll visualization, I wanted to display the number of women and counties suffering without abortion resources. To achieve this, I reversed the y-axis to be increasing from the top left to the bottom left. By reversing the scale, the chart is seemingly more top filled and catches the viewer's eye, making the claims more believable. While the top down axis worked really well, I don't love the x axis because unconventional methods can catch the viewer by surprise. I considered making the plot display the number of counties that have resources and have an upright axis, but the graph just didn't seem as interesting or convincing. Also, I considered a scatter plot, but the emptiness of the graph was counter productive as the visual wasn't compelling. Ultimately, I settled on this design because without reading any of the axes, the viewer can feel the widespread issue from the visualizaiton.</li>
			<li>Skewed / Charged Titles (Deceptive: 1): From the title "My Body, Your Choice?" to the annotations about nearly 100% of the counties lacking the resources, the titles lead the user to believe that there is a lack of access to abortion services around the US. The titles are particularly charged which can aid the user in viewing the visualization from a specific perspective. However, the main title may be a bit too charged, detering conservative or moderate viewers from the visualization. I think the main title is good for setting the context in a funny way, but there is a possibility that a viewer may be skeptical about the authenticity of the data shown. When putting together the final visualization, I thought about changing the title to something more basic and direct like "Lack of Abortion Access". I'm sure reading the aforementioned title did not interest you, as it didn't excite me. To prioritize getting a reaction or grasping the viewer's attention, I felt that the more charged title accomplishes more than the relatively neutral title.</li>
			<li>Gestation Times for the Round Trip Time Maps (Deceptive: 0.5): By joining on The Pudding's Driving Times to Abortion Clinics in the US dataset, the visualization is able to display the round trip time for a women to get an abortion around the US at specific gestation times. To increase the impact of the dataset, I included later gestation times (12, 16, 20 weeks) rather than the earlier ones (0, 4, 8) to convince the user that many women around continental US do not have easy access to abortion. Similarly, to create a larger contrast between the maps, I made sure that the start of the range (0) was light pink and the maximum time for a round trip is plotted, thereby skewing the viewer into believing that most women in the US are having great difficulty in the getting access to clinics. Overall, this is really effective convincing the viewer, but if noticed, the viewer may question how trustworthy the results are. Besides this, I considered just displaying the values for all the weeks, but the tabular format or scatter plot was too boring. The viewer needs to see something different, so the map visualization can really draw in the viewer.</li>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
		Through the design process of these visualizations, I encountered the challenging dichotomy between persuasive clarity and ethical representation. One of the most striking realizations was the thin line that separates emphasizing and embellishing a fact. It conveyed how important conscious design descisions are in delivery of data, especially in visualizations that aim to persuade a viewer. Initially, the task seemed straightforward: present data in a manner that supports a specific proposition: abortion is accessible. However, manipulating design elements to shape the narrative started to unveil the difficulty in remaining ethical. It was surprising to discover the extent to which subtle changes in color schemes, axis orientations, and data categorizations could significantly alter the perception of the information. Honestly, this practice was eye-opening about the influence of visual design in data storytelling. Personally, I found creating deceptive visualizations was quite easy, but remaining transparent and truthful in a persuasive narrative challenging. Although it was initially a bit difficult to subtly make these modifications, data transformations, additions of data, and omission of information made the job much easier such that the viewer would have no idea that there was even any manipulation. For example, the change of the center in the diverging red-blue gradient was a quick fix that drastically changed the appearance of the map without an obvious indication to the user. This is scary. <br><br>
		Upon completion of the assignment, my defintion of ethical analysis and visualization has changed. Before, I honestly believed that most visualizations that didn't falsify data or came from reputable news sources were ethical. But, I was really wrong. Ethical analysis and visualization don't just happen but rather, are a series of guidelines to ensure that transparency and respect for the audience is prioritized. We make conscious decisions to make sure that the visualizations are ethical; this doesn't happen by default. <br><br>
		The bounds of the ethical data visualizations can be clear cut in some situations. For instance, displaying the total values for the total public funding is valid or the reversed y axis to amplify the impact are okay. On the other hand, adjusting the center of the color scale is definitely not ethical. However, in most situations, the bounds are really blurry. In one visualization, it might be okay to have a logarithmic scale in the scientific community because the audience expects it, but it might be considered inappropriate to have the scale in the New York Times. Beyond audience or domain changes, there are overall questions that do not have simple answers: Is omitting data unethical? Is it unethical to remove outliers? Questions like these can blur the line between right or wrong. I can see a debate where some may argue the viewer needs to be more intelligent throguh skepticism while others may point to the fact that viewers may be lead astray. The decision between distinguish “acceptable” persuasive choices vs. “misleading” ones is not very clear to me, and it has become even more clear after this assignment. This assignment has validated my opinoin that neutrality is a construct that we all should strive for but should never expect to achieve. Regardless, a code of ethics or design principles may be beneficial in grounding the industry standard and create a baseline for visualizations.<br><br>
