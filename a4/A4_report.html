    <h2>Proposition: Abortion is Accessible to Everyone</h2>

      		<h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

					Abortion is easily accessible across the US with new abortion clinics, massive amounts of public funding, and an increasing number of abortion providers.

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Diverging Color Scheme with a Nonzero Center (Deceptive: 2): The diverging color scheme (specifically red and blue) plays into the political representations of the perspectives. Since this visualization was trying to support that abortion is easily accessible, it makes sense that the viewer would want to blame the "liberals" or "pro-choice" individuals which is associated with blue. To play into the existing frameworks of the viewer, the visualization is more persuasive because the viewer will subconsciously make associations without having to directly explain them. To really make this deceptive, I changed the center of the color scale to be -2, so more of the states seem to have created new clinics. To skew the scale actually worked really well in portraying the opinion that more clinics are being created. However, the results so seem a bit fishy with New York removing clinics, while Texas is adding them. Therefore, the viewer may not be completely fooled and may begin to question the authenticity of the data. Other alternatives I considered were only displaying the liberal states or only displaying a region of states. However, I ultimately chose to display all the states because I was worried that viewers may easily question why only specific states were at the focal point of the visualization, detering their attention from the actual perspective conveyed.</li>
				<li>Titles and Map Annotations about New Clinics Created (Deceptive: 1): The title "Abortion: Is it too easy?" is quite blunt with the perspective of the visualization. The other annotations that only portray the increase in clinics are a bit more subtle in their delivery, persuading the reader that there is more abortion clinics in the USA. For the annotation "More than 40 new clinics created", I transformed the data to only include values where new clinics were created, removing instances where clinics were shut down. If I had just looked at the net change in the number of clinics, it actually would have been a negative figure. To display the sum of the new clinics was a strategic move that actually worked really well, since the viewer doesn't have access to the raw data. However, the other annotations may not have been too great because the viewer may questions why New York or Florida weren't highlighted. Lastly, the title may not be suitable for the visualization if the purpose is to remain neutral, so a less charged title may help. Originally, I considered placing the net number of clinics in each state, but the visualization was too busy and difficult to interpret. Additionally, I considered including a table of the top states that had new clinics, but the table felt disconnected from the map visualization and wasn't effective in delivery. Thus, I decided on small text annotations instead of larger annotations. </li>
				<li>Comparison between US Regions rather US States (Deceptive: 0.5): The bottom two bar plots show four US regions and the number of abortion providers or publicly funded abortions. The states are grouped into regions based on the separation by the US Census Bureau Regions and Divisions dataset (Joined on the US State in the provided dataset). The grouping of the states into regions makes the bar plot easier to interpret by reducing 50 columns into 4 columns, so the viewer is able to verify the claims. Additionally, the grouping actually hides the variation amongst states and allows for a more homogenous comparison between the regions. While the differences are hidden, the bar plot representations aren't the most interesting, loweing the chance that the attention of the viewer is grabbed. I considered pie charts, scatter plots, and dual axis charts; aside from the increased pockets of whitespace, I wanted to keep the focus on the map visualization, so I tried to simplify the visualizations or graphics below. </li>
				<li>Logarithmic Scale on the Publicly Funded Abortions (Deceptive: 2): The botton left bar plot is very deceptive. The scale for the y-axis is Logarithmic which can skew the reader to believe the impact is much greater than it actually is. Readers at quick glance will be swayed to believe that there are a lot of publicly funded abortions in the US in all the regions. This is effective in convincing the viewer that the access to abortions is not a concern; however, this is effective only if the reader quickly peruses the information rather than deeply analyzes the content. Therefore, there is a chance that this deception may be very clear to the viewer, so hopefully, this remains hidden to amplify the impact. As alternatives, I considered comparing the publicly funded abortions over a couple of years, but the results weren't looking too great. Also, I tried to create a pie chart or keep a linear scale, but the representation was not as convincing.</li>
				<li>Totals for Public Funding and Teenage Abortions (Earnest: 1): The numerical values in the visualization are really descriptive and persuasive in showing the great impact. For instance, the grand scale of the values $71M and approximately 60,000 teenage abortions make it easy to persuade individuals that abortion is easily available. The size, bold, and center location of the metrics emphasizes the impact of the values. To obtain this information, I filtered out null values and added up the total around the US for the greatest impact. While the values are impactful, too many values or text can be difficult for the viewer to read. Specifically, this version of the text is from historic data (2015 and 2017), reducing the impact since viewers may not feel connected to the years. As the values aren't as relevant anymore, I tried to explore opportunities of placing the information in tables, but the values weren't as impactful. Secondly, I wanted to place the individual values on the map, but once again, the map was too crowded and not digestable. Thus, it made the most sense to simply choose two statistics to display to the user.</li>

				Lack of access to abortion is portrayed through the sheer percentage of counties without a clinic, the great percentage of women without a clinic, and the long round trip tips to a nearby abortion clinic.

		How does this decision help make your visualization persuasive? What worked well, and what didn’t? What other alternatives did you consider, and why did you settle on this one?

		<ul>
			<li>Reversed Axis in the Main Graph (Deceptive: 1): </li>
			<li>Skewed / Charged Titles (Deceptive: 1):</li>
			<li>Gestation Times for the Round Trip Time Maps (Deceptive: 0.5): </li>
			<li>Annotations about the Lack of Abortion Clinics (Deceptive: 1): </li>
			<li>Color Schemes for the Visualizations (Deceptive: 0.5): </li>
