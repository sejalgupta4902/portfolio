			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

			<h3>Question: How does the composition of the population change between 1900 and 2000?</h3>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

		
			<ul>
				<li>Motivation: My motivation behind generating this sketch was that I wanted to visualize the composition of men and women in the population over various age groups.</li> 
				<li>Communicate: I really wanted to see the drastic difference betweent the population number or subpopulations over the years. Specifically, I wanted to show a comparison between the composition of the population in 1900 and 2000.</li>
				<li>What worked?: The population graphs worked really well in showing the change in age and population within a single year. For instance, it's very clear that, in 2000, there was a large population in the 40s (probably due to the baby boomer generation).</li>
				<li>What didn't work?: While we could see a general trend of increase in population between 1900 and 2000, it is really difficult to compare the men and women in specific age groups across the years. The two graphs make it difficult to make specific comparison about the composition.</li>
				<li>Future Exploration: I want to explore a better method for having a singular graph that depicts the composition, so that the viewer is not burdened with figuring it out him or herself.</li>
			</ul>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Motivation: I wanted to visualize the composition of the population in a component and holistic perspective. Specifically, I wanted to display the numbers for the population, but also quantify the population through normalization; I did the latter by obtaining the cumulative percentage.</li> 
				<li>Communicate: I really wanted to see the impact of different age groups on the population makeup. Specifically, I wanted to showcase the subpopulations in the population and how they contribute to the overall population.</li>
				<li>What worked?: While the count of the population allows for a direct comparison between the two years, the cumulative percentage depicts the percentage contribution of the age group. I think the count and percentage on a dual axis was really effective in showing the trends. Also, due to the same age buckets x axis, the overlay of the cumulative percentage was very clean.</li>
				<li>What didn't work?: The graph is quite busy. There are too many ideas going on, making it difficult for the viewer to have a concise or simplistic takeway from the graph. Specifically, the dotted vs. connected lines and the separaton between the male and female make the graph very difficult to interpret. Specifically, the separation between 1900 and 2000 is difficult to distinguish.</li>
				<li>Future Exploration: I want to explore picking and choosing specific data points / features to depict. More is not always better on a single graph. Therefore, I want to minimize the number of variations in the graph and try to stay consistent between the comparisons.</li>
			</ul>
