			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

			<h3>Question: How does the composition of the population change between 1900 and 2000?</h3>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

		
			<ul>
				<li>Motivation: My motivation behind generating this sketch was that I wanted to visualize the composition of men and women in the population over various age groups.</li> 
				<li>Communicate: I really wanted to see the drastic difference betweent the population number or subpopulations over the years. Specifically, I wanted to show a comparison between the composition of the population in 1900 and 2000.</li>
				<li>What worked?: The population graphs worked really well in showing the change in age and population within a single year. For instance, it's very clear that, in 2000, there was a large population in the 40s (probably due to the baby boomer generation).</li>
				<li>What didn't work?: While we could see a general trend of increase in population between 1900 and 2000, it is really difficult to compare the men and women in specific age groups across the years. The two graphs make it difficult to make specific comparison about the composition.</li>
				<li>Future Exploration: I want to explore a better method for having a singular graph that depicts the composition, so that the viewer is not burdened with figuring it out him or herself.</li>
			</ul>
