			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

			<h3>Question: How does the composition of the population change between 1900 and 2000?</h3>

				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

		
			<ul>
				<li>Motivation: My motivation behind generating this sketch was that I wanted to visualize the composition of men and women in the population over various age groups.</li> 
				<li>Communicate: I really wanted to see the drastic difference betweent the population number or subpopulations over the years. Specifically, I wanted to show a comparison between the composition of the population in 1900 and 2000.</li>
				<li>What worked?: The population graphs worked really well in showing the change in age and population within a single year. For instance, it's very clear that, in 2000, there was a large population in the 40s (probably due to the baby boomer generation).</li>
				<li>What didn't work?: While we could see a general trend of increase in population between 1900 and 2000, it is really difficult to compare the men and women in specific age groups across the years. The two graphs make it difficult to make specific comparison about the composition.</li>
				<li>Future Exploration: I want to explore a better method for having a singular graph that depicts the composition, so that the viewer is not burdened with figuring it out him or herself.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Motivation: I wanted to visualize the composition of the population in a component and holistic perspective. Specifically, I wanted to display the numbers for the population, but also quantify the population through normalization; I did the latter by obtaining the cumulative percentage.</li> 
				<li>Communicate: I really wanted to see the impact of different age groups on the population makeup. Specifically, I wanted to showcase the subpopulations in the population and how they contribute to the overall population.</li>
				<li>What worked?: While the count of the population allows for a direct comparison between the two years, the cumulative percentage depicts the percentage contribution of the age group. I think the count and percentage on a dual axis was really effective in showing the trends. Also, due to the same age buckets x axis, the overlay of the cumulative percentage was very clean.</li>
				<li>What didn't work?: The graph is quite busy. There are too many ideas going on, making it difficult for the viewer to have a concise or simplistic takeway from the graph. Specifically, the dotted vs. connected lines and the separaton between the male and female make the graph very difficult to interpret. Specifically, the separation between 1900 and 2000 is difficult to distinguish.</li>
				<li>Future Exploration: I want to explore picking and choosing specific data points / features to depict. More is not always better on a single graph. Therefore, I want to minimize the number of variations in the graph and try to stay consistent between the comparisons.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Motivation: The previous graphs don't do a good job of depicting the difference between male and female in a particular age group across the years.</li> 
				<li>Communicate: I wanted to visualize the difference between the male and females in the age group while keeping the population count in mind. Basically, I wanted the viewer to get the degree to which females or males dominated an age group while perserving the total population count values.</li>
				<li>What worked?: The gradient of the colors works for telling which portion of the population (male or female) was greater. Additionally, the segmentation of the population counts by age group makes it easier to visualize the percentage of contribution and the number.</li>
				<li>What didn't work?: It's not a very pretty graph. The gradient is confusing because the baseline is 0, but the bounds are change for each population. While the user can calculate the other group, it's not effective. Additionally, the two bars for the years don't look very good. They are harder to interpret and the composition isn't easily comparable. Overall, it is less effective that the other visualizations.</li>
				<li>Future Exploration: I want to explore potentially reducing the variation in color in the graph. This will make it easier for the viewer to understand. Also, year should not be the x axis.</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        The three sketch provide a wide variety of data representations and visualizations. The first graph is very concise and clear in its representation of the data, making it extremely simple for the user to extract the information. However, the viewer faces difficulty in synthesizing the information in the graph, as there are two side by side comparisons. Sketch 2 improves on the comparison by putting all the information in one graph, but it employs a dual axis scheme with a line plot overlayed on top of the scatter plot. Unfortunately, the variation in color, shape, and design amongst the various categories makes Sketch 2 difficult to interpret for the viewer. To improve the variation in marks, Sketch 3 simplifies the markings to only include bars and a gradient of two colors; this simplification makes it easier for the viewer to digest. However, overall, this sketch is by far the least effective in the actual portrayal of the composition of the graph because the viewer doesn't really know how to understand the gradient scale. For my final sketch, I really want to prioritize a single chart (no side-by-side charts) with a selection of features (concise) that have very clear markings (clarity) for the viewer.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				From my learnings in Phase 1, I really wanted to be clear unlike sketch 2 which had too many facets that did not contribute towards a single storyline, have descriptive markings unlike sketch 3 where the gradient coloring confused the viewer about the truth value, and have a singular graph unlike sketch 1 that has a side-by-side comparison. In order to remain clear, I stayed constant with my color / marking choice. To consolidate my design to be easily digestable, I removed the gender depiction and focused on population shifts within age groups. While this may downplay the impact of gender on the population shift and amplify the impact of age groups on the shift, this decision was made to emphasize the change in population without overwhelming the viewer. Lastly, I stuck with the dual axis approach to provide all the information in a single chart. To augment the data, I kept a running sum and percentage of the population within a single year to display the cumulative percentage over time.
				In constructing this visualization, I prioritized clarity and comparative analysis, as I noted in my reflection of the Phase 1 sketches. The bar chart displays the population count for each age group; unlike Phase 1 where the difference between the years was by marks, different colors (purple and blue) facilitate quick visual differentiation to allow the viewer to compare the population of different age groups at a glance. To remain consistent, the blue and purple colors are used as the markers on the scatter plot to represent the cumulative percentage of the population up to a certain age. This was chosen to communicate how the proportion of the population within certain age brackets has changed over time, particularly illustrating the increase in the older population in 2000. 
				The visualization presented is a dual-axis chart comparing the population count and cumulative percentage of age groups in 1900 and 2000. This design choice allows for a direct comparison between the two years, emphasizing the growth in population and shifts in age distribution over the century. The visualization design succeeds in telling a story of population growth and aging between 1900 and 2000 by allowing a side-by-side comparison of population counts and the cumulative increase in population of age groups. Visual encodings such as color, size, and mark are used to simply describe to the reader the changes in the population composition.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        Phase One was instrumental in shaping the final design, but it might have influenced the final design too much. By sticking with a dual-axis approach and consistent color/marking choices, the final visualization aimed to maintain the viewer's focus on the crucial aspect of the narrative: how the composition of the population changed between 1900 and 2000. While the sketching helped to solidify the need for clarity, comparability, and simplicity, the sketching skewed my perspective on the types of visualizations that I could use. When it came to the final visualization, I was drawn to the sketch 2 design, so I prioritized my final design in that manner. Even though it was an effective visualization, I wonder if the creativity diminished by having the comparison between the sketches. However, the final visualization use a consistent color scheme between 1900 and 2000, a scatter plot overlayed on top of a bar chart, and a x axis for age groups to best portray the population shift through combining the best elements from the sketches from Phase 1.
